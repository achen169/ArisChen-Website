# Aris Chen

Psychology📚

I was born in Sunnyvale, California. I grew up with two siblings: One older brother and one younger sister. I was born to first generation Taiwanese parents. Coming from the Bay Area and Silicon Valley Area, I developed an interest in computer related hobbies such as Computer science, Video Making, and Video Gaming. Despite this, I decided that I would pursue my interest in Psychology, although I have not narrowed my focus down to any particular subfield as of yet.
